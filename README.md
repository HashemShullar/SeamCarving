# Seam Carving

Image retargeting is the process of changing the aspect ratio of an image without introducing artifacts or distorting the important parts. Its applications vary from Computer Vision pre-processing steps to photo editing softwares. Recent developments in foldable phone have also triggered interest in image retargeting since these algorithms help in improving the user experience. Seam Carving is a discrete retargeting method where the aspect ratio of the image is iteratively changed by generating top-down and left-right lines along which the modifications occur.

This code was developed for EE 663 (Image Processing) course at KFUPM.
